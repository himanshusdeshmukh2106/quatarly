# âœ… Fonts Are Working! Final Tweaks

## Progress: Fonts are showing differences!

You mentioned seeing differences in character appearance - this means the fonts ARE loading! ðŸŽ‰

## What I Just Fixed:

### Removed `fontWeight: '700'` from heading styles

When using `spacegrotesk_bold.ttf` (which already IS bold), adding `fontWeight: '700'` can cause conflicts where Android tries to apply bold to an already-bold font, sometimes reverting to system font.

### Fixed in:
- âœ… HomeScreen header
- âœ… textStyles.ts (all h1-h6)
- âœ… All components use proper font names

## Current Font Configuration:

```typescript
// Headings (Space Grotesk Bold)
fontFamily: 'spacegrotesk'  // XML family name
// NO fontWeight needed!

// Body text (IBM Plex Sans Regular)  
fontFamily: 'ibmplexsans'   // XML family name
fontWeight: '400'           // OK for regular fonts

// Financial numbers (IBM Plex Mono)
fontFamily: 'ibmplexmono'   // XML family name
fontWeight: '400'           // OK for regular fonts
```

## Rebuild to see improvements:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## What You Should See Now:

1. **Headers** - Bolder, more distinct (Space Grotesk Bold)
2. **Body text** - Clean, professional (IBM Plex Sans)
3. **Numbers/Prices** - Monospaced, easier to read (IBM Plex Mono)

The differences should be MUCH more noticeable now without the fontWeight conflicts!

Check especially:
- HomeScreen header text
- Asset card titles
- Portfolio values and percentages

The fonts are working - this final tweak should make them really pop! ðŸŽ¨
