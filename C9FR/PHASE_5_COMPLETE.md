## Completed Tasks

### Task 22: Create useAssetActions Hook ✅

**File Created**: `src/screens/main/AssetsScreen/hooks/useAssetActions.ts`

**Features Implemented**:
- Asset long press handling
- Edit asset flow with modal management
- Delete asset flow with confirmation dialog
- Save asset with error handling
- Modal state management (action sheet, edit modal)
- Integration with useAssets hook

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
- handleAssetLongPress(asset: Asset): void
- handleEditAsset(asset: Asset): void
- handleSaveAsset(updatedAsset: Asset, updateFn): Promise<void>
- handleDeleteAsset(asset: Asset, deleteFn): Promise<void>
- closeActionSheet(): void
- closeEditModal(): void
```

**State Management**:
- `showActionSheet`: boolean
- `showEditModal`: boolean
- `savingAsset`: boolean
- `selectedAssetForAction`: Asset | null
- `editingAsset`: Asset | null

## Next Steps

Phase 5 is now complete. The AssetsScreen has been fully refactored with:
- Modular component structure
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean separation of concerns

**Recommended Next Actions**:
1. Review Phase 6-13 tasks to determine priority
2. Consider implementing Phase 9 (Additional Screen Refactoring) to apply the same patterns to GoalsScreen and OpportunitiesScreen
3. Or proceed with Phase 10-13 for code splitting, accessibility, testing infrastructure, and documentation

---

## Performance Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- AssetsScreen: 1,399 lines
- No separation of concerns
- Limited test coverage

### After Refactoring
- AssetsScreen: ~200 lines
- 10+ modular components
- 2 custom hooks
- 36 comprehensive tests
- **85.7% reduction in main file size**

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hook Extraction**: Extracting action handlers to a custom hook significantly improved code organization and testability
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing comprehensive tests helped catch edge cases early
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages improved UX
4. **Integration Testing**: Testing hook-to-hook integration revealed important interaction patterns
