## Benefits of Cleanup

1. ✅ **Reduced Confusion** - Only one AssetsScreen now (AssetsScreenFinal)
2. ✅ **Clearer Codebase** - No duplicate/legacy files
3. ✅ **Easier Maintenance** - Single source of truth for assets screen
4. ✅ **Smaller Bundle** - Removed unused code
5. ✅ **Better Performance** - Less code to parse and bundle

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Implement AssetDetailScreen Navigation**
   - Add onPress handler in PerplexityInvestmentCard
   - Navigate to AssetDetailScreen with investment data

2. **Update Tests**
   - Update AssetsScreen tests to test AssetsScreenFinal
   - Remove tests for deleted components

3. **Consider Renaming**
   - Rename AssetsScreenFinal.tsx to AssetsScreen.tsx for clarity
   - Update imports in HomeScreen.tsx

git checkout <commit-hash> -- "path/to/deleted/file"
```
