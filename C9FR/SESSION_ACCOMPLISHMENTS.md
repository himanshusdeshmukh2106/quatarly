## 🔍 Detailed Changes This Session

### 1. GoalsScreen Refactoring

**File**: `src/screens/main/GoalsScreen.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
import { fetchGoals, createGoal } from '../../services/api';
const [goals, setGoals] = useState<Goal[]>([]);
const loadGoals = async () => { /* manual API call */ };

// After
import { useGoals } from '../../hooks/useGoals';
const { goals, loading, error, createNewGoal, loadGoals } = useGoals();
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => { /* ... */ }, [loadGoals]);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent with other screens
- ✅ Centralized state management
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Optimized with useCallback

### 2. GoalsScreen Integration Tests

**File**: `src/__tests__/integration/screens/GoalsScreen.integration.test.tsx`

**Test Coverage**:
- Screen loading and display
- Goal details rendering
- AI insights display
- Refresh functionality
- Error handling
- Image error handling
- Add goal flow
- AI insights drawer
- Empty state

**Test Count**: 9 comprehensive tests

### 3. OpportunitiesScreen Refactoring

**File**: `src/screens/main/OpportunitiesScreen.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
import { fetchOpportunities, refreshOpportunities } from '../../services/api';
const [opportunities, setOpportunities] = useState<Opportunity[]>([]);
const loadOpportunities = async () => { /* manual API call */ };

// After
import { useOpportunities } from '../../hooks/useOpportunities';
const { opportunities, loading, error, refreshOpportunities: refreshOps } = useOpportunities();
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => { /* ... */ }, [refreshOps]);
```

**Metrics**:
- Lines reduced: 290 → 255 (12% reduction)
- Removed manual state management
- Applied useCallback optimization
