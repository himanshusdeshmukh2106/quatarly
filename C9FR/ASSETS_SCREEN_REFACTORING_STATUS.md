# AssetsScreen Refactoring Status

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring progress of the AssetsScreen component (originally 1,351 lines).

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Task 17: Create AssetsScreen directory structure ✅
- Created `src/screens/AssetsScreen/` directory
- Created `src/screens/AssetsScreen/components/` subdirectory
- Created `src/screens/AssetsScreen/hooks/` subdirectory
- Created `src/screens/AssetsScreen/utils/` subdirectory

### Task 18: Extract PortfolioSummary component ✅
- Created `PortfolioSummary.tsx` component
- Extracted portfolio summary card logic
- Maintains exact same UI/UX with:
  - Portfolio Value display
  - Total Returns display
  - Today's Change display
  - Return Rate display
  - Market status indicator
- Uses React.memo for performance optimization
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Accessibility labels included

### Task 19: Extract AssetFilters component ✅
- Created `AssetFilters.tsx` component
- Currently returns null (no filters in original implementation)
- Placeholder for future filter functionality
- Maintains identical UI/UX (no visible filters)

### Task 20: Extract AddAssetButton component ✅
- Created `AddAssetButton.tsx` component
- Extracted "Add Investment" button with dropdown
- Maintains exact same UI/UX with:
  - Add manually option
  - Add by PDF/Doc option (shows "Coming Soon" alert)
- Proper accessibility labels
- Theme integration

### Task 24: Refactor main AssetsScreen component ✅ (Partial)
- Created `index.tsx` that re-exports original AssetsScreen
- Exports extracted components for future use
- Maintains backward compatibility
- **Status**: Transitional implementation

## Pending Tasks ⏳

### Task 21: Create AssetList component with virtualization
- Need to extract asset list rendering logic
- Implement FlatList with optimization props
- Support different asset card types (tradable, physical)
- Add empty state UI

### Task 21.1: Write unit tests for AssetList component
- Test renders list of assets correctly
- Test empty state display
- Test renderItem callback memoization
- Test keyExtractor

### Task 22: Create useAssetActions hook
- Extract asset action handlers (edit, delete, longPress)
- Implement useCallback for all handlers
- Add proper error handling with ApiError
- TypeScript return type interface

### Task 22.1: Write unit tests for useAssetActions hook
- Test handleEdit updates state correctly
- Test handleDelete shows confirmation
- Test error handling

### Task 23: Create usePortfolioData hook
- Extract portfolio data fetching and calculations
- Implement useMemo for calculated values
- Add loading and error states
- TypeScript return type interface

### Task 24: Complete refactoring of main AssetsScreen component
- Update to use extracted components
- Remove extracted logic
- Ensure file is under 200 lines
- **CRITICAL**: Verify UI/UX is pixel-perfect identical
- Verify all functionality works exactly as before

### Task 24.1: Write integration tests for AssetsScreen
- Test screen loads and displays assets
- Test add asset flow end-to-end
- Test edit asset flow end-to-end
- Test delete asset flow end-to-end
- Test error states display correctly

## Current File Sizes

- **Original AssetsScreen.tsx**: 1,351 lines
- **Target**: < 200 lines for main component
- **Current Status**: Original file still in use (transitional phase)

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Extraction (Current) ✅
Extract reusable components while keeping original file intact:
- ✅ PortfolioSummary
- ✅ AssetFilters (placeholder)
- ✅ AddAssetButton
- ⏳ AssetList (pending)

### Phase 2: Hook Extraction (Next)
Extract business logic into custom hooks:
- ⏳ useAssetActions
- ⏳ usePortfolioData

### Phase 3: Integration (Final)
Update main AssetsScreen to use extracted components and hooks:
- Replace inline JSX with extracted components
- Replace inline logic with custom hooks
- Verify UI/UX remains identical
- Add comprehensive tests

## Critical Constraints

### UI/UX Must Remain Identical ⚠️
- **NO changes** to visual appearance
- **NO changes** to layouts or styling
- **NO changes** to user interactions or flows
- **NO changes** to component rendering output
- Rendered output must be pixel-perfect identical

### Testing Requirements
- All extracted components must have unit tests
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing recommended
- Manual testing required before deployment

## Notes

### Why Transitional Approach?
The original AssetsScreen is 1,351 lines with complex logic including:
- Mock investment data rendering
- Multiple modal states
- Dropdown management
- Asset card rendering logic
- Portfolio calculations
- Theme integration

A complete refactoring in one step risks breaking the UI/UX. The transitional approach:
1. Extracts components gradually
2. Tests each extraction independently
3. Maintains backward compatibility
4. Allows for incremental validation
5. Reduces risk of breaking changes

### Next Steps
1. Complete Task 21: Create AssetList component
2. Complete Task 22: Create useAssetActions hook
3. Complete Task 23: Create usePortfolioData hook
4. Complete Task 24: Integrate all extracted components
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Verify UI/UX is identical
7. Remove original AssetsScreen.tsx

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ 3 components extracted (PortfolioSummary, AssetFilters, AddAssetButton)
- ⏳ AssetList component created
- ⏳ 2 custom hooks created (useAssetActions, usePortfolioData)
- ⏳ Main component under 200 lines
- ⏳ UI/UX verified as identical
- ⏳ All tests passing
- ⏳ No TypeScript errors
- ⏳ No accessibility regressions
