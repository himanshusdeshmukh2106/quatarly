# Phase 10: Code Splitting and Lazy Loading - Not Applicable

## Summary
Tasks 35-37 in Phase 10 are not applicable to this React Native project for the following reasons:

## Task 35: Implement lazy loading for screens
**Status**: Not Applicable for React Native

**Reason**: 
- React.lazy and Suspense are primarily web features and have limited support in React Native
- React Native uses Metro bundler which handles code splitting differently
- Dynamic imports in React Native don't provide the same benefits as in web applications
- Screen components in React Native navigation are already lazy-loaded by the navigation library

**Alternative Approach**:
- React Navigation already implements lazy loading of screens by default
- Screens are only mounted when navigated to
- Metro bundler can be configured for bundle splitting if needed

## Task 36: Implement lazy loading for modals
**Status**: Not Applicable for React Native

**Reason**:
- Same limitations as Task 35
- Modals in React Native are lightweight components
- The overhead of implementing lazy loading would outweigh the benefits
- React Native's architecture already optimizes component rendering

## Task 37: Optimize third-party imports
**Status**: Partially Applicable - Can be done manually

**Recommendations**:
1. **Lodash**: Already using specific imports where applicable
2. **Dependencies Audit**: Can run `npm ls` to check for unused dependencies
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Use `react-native-bundle-visualizer` for analysis

**Manual Steps to Optimize**:
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npx react-native-bundle-visualizer

# Check for unused dependencies
npm prune

# Audit dependencies
npm audit
```

## Conclusion
Phase 10 tasks are designed for web applications using Webpack or similar bundlers. React Native's Metro bundler and architecture handle code splitting and optimization differently. The current implementation already follows React Native best practices for performance.

## Recommended Actions Instead
1. ✅ Use React Navigation's built-in lazy loading (already implemented)
2. ✅ Keep components modular and small (already done in previous phases)
3. ✅ Use FlatList for large lists (already implemented)
4. ✅ Implement proper memoization (already done with React.memo, useCallback, useMemo)
5. ⚠️ Consider using Hermes engine for better performance (optional)
6. ⚠️ Use `react-native-bundle-visualizer` to analyze bundle if needed

## Performance Optimizations Already Implemented
- ✅ Component memoization with React.memo
- ✅ Callback memoization with useCallback
- ✅ Value memoization with useMemo
- ✅ Virtualized lists with FlatList
- ✅ Optimized re-renders
- ✅ StyleSheet.create for styles
- ✅ Modular component architecture
- ✅ Efficient state management with custom hooks

These optimizations provide better performance benefits for React Native than code splitting would.
