## Recommendation

The changes have been applied to **PerplexityInvestmentCard.tsx** which is the correct file.

If changes are not visible:
1. Clear React Native cache: `npx expo start -c`
2. Reload the app completely
3. Check if there are any build errors in the terminal
4. Verify the app is using AssetsScreenFinal (not AssetsScreen)
