# Definitive Font Test - Let's Find What's Wrong

## I've disabled the global font override

The global font override in App.tsx might be preventing fonts from working. I've temporarily disabled it.

## Test Plan:

### 1. Add FontDebugScreen to your app

In HomeScreen.tsx, temporarily replace the content with:
```typescript
import FontDebugScreen from './FontDebugScreen';

return <FontDebugScreen />;
```

### 2. Rebuild and check

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### 3. Look at the screen

- Do ANY fonts look different?
- Does "monospace" look different from default?
- Does ANY custom font name work?

### 4. Check Android logs

Run:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "font"
```

Look for errors like:
- "Font not found"
- "Missing font"
- "Unrecognized font family"

## Report back:

1. Do built-in fonts (monospace, sans-serif) work?
2. Do custom fonts show ANY difference?
3. What errors appear in logcat?

## If NOTHING changes:

This means React Native isn't recognizing fontFamily property AT ALL. This could be:
1. React Native 0.80 bug
2. Build configuration issue
3. Some override happening at app level

Let me know what you see and I'll provide the next fix.
