# BHARAT SM Data Integration Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

The current BHARAT SM data integration has several critical issues that prevent it from functioning efficiently and providing valid data. This spec addresses the optimization of the Indian stock market data fetching system to ensure reliable, accurate, and efficient data retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Library Installation and Availability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the BHARAT SM libraries to be properly installed and available, so that the system can fetch real Indian stock market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN both `Fundamentals` and `Technical` libraries SHALL be available
2. WHEN libraries are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
3. WHEN libraries fail to import THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative data sources
4. WHEN checking library availability THEN the system SHALL return accurate status information

### Requirement 2: Efficient Data Fetching Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the data fetching to be optimized for performance, so that API calls are minimized and response times are fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching stock data THEN the system SHALL use batch processing where possible
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching mechanisms
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use efficient pandas operations
4. WHEN extracting specific data points THEN the system SHALL use optimized lookup methods
5. WHEN handling multiple symbols THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently where safe

### Requirement 3: Data Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to receive accurate and valid stock market data, so that I can make informed investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL validate all numeric values for reasonableness
2. WHEN volume data is formatted THEN the system SHALL use consistent Indian number formatting
3. WHEN P/E ratios are extracted THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like negative or zero values
4. WHEN growth rates are calculated THEN the system SHALL verify the calculation logic
5. WHEN market cap is processed THEN the system SHALL convert units correctly (Cr to actual values)

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to continue working even when some data sources fail, so that I always get the best available information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BHARAT SM API fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to Perplexity API
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN invalid symbols are provided THEN the system SHALL return empty results gracefully
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately
5. WHEN data parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available data

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests that verify data accuracy, so that I can ensure the system works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify actual data values against known benchmarks
2. WHEN testing volume formatting THEN the system SHALL validate Indian number format accuracy
3. WHEN testing growth calculations THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical correctness
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL confirm graceful degradation
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track API response times and success rates

### Requirement 6: Optimized Volume Data Retrieval

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to see accurate trading volume data in readable format, so that I can assess stock liquidity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching volume data THEN the system SHALL use the most efficient API endpoints
2. WHEN volume data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL try alternative data sources
3. WHEN formatting volume THEN the system SHALL use Indian conventions (Cr, L, K)
4. WHEN volume is zero or negative THEN the system SHALL handle these edge cases appropriately
5. WHEN caching volume data THEN the system SHALL respect market hours for cache duration

### Requirement 7: Market Cap and Financial Ratios Accuracy

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want accurate market cap and P/E ratio data, so that I can perform proper stock analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting market cap THEN the system SHALL convert from Crores to actual values correctly
2. WHEN P/E ratios are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return null instead of zero
3. WHEN financial data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate data freshness
4. WHEN ratios are extreme THEN the system SHALL validate against reasonable ranges
5. WHEN multiple data sources provide different values THEN the system SHALL use the most reliable source

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the data fetching to be fast and efficient, so that users get quick responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same symbol is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL use cached data when appropriate
2. WHEN market is closed THEN the system SHALL extend cache duration
3. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling
4. WHEN fetching related data THEN the system SHALL batch API calls
5. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL refresh data in background

### Requirement 9: Library Documentation Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the implementation to follow the official BHARAT SM documentation, so that the integration is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using MoneyControl API THEN the system SHALL follow documented parameter formats
2. WHEN using Technical API THEN the system SHALL use correct method signatures
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL parse data according to documentation
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and best practices
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them as documented

### Requirement 10: Integration Testing with Real Data

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want tests that verify real data accuracy, so that I can ensure the system provides valid information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with known stocks THEN the system SHALL return reasonable price ranges
2. WHEN testing volume data THEN the system SHALL verify against market expectations
3. WHEN testing P/E ratios THEN the system SHALL validate against industry norms
4. WHEN testing growth rates THEN the system SHALL verify calculation accuracy
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL confirm proper error handling
